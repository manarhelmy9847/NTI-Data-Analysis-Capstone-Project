## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

### üßº Data Quality Issues

To ensure clean and reliable data, the following issues were identified and addressed:

1. Removed duplicated rows to prevent double-counting.
2. Standardized `Rating` values to fall within the 0‚Äì10 range by scaling down any values above 10.
3. Cleaned the `Unit Price` column by removing non-numeric characters and converting values to float.
4. Converted negative values in the `Quantity` column to positive.
5. Filled missing values in the `Tax 5%` column by recalculating the correct tax amounts.
6. Rounded values in the `Tax 5%` and `Total` columns to four decimal places for consistency.
7. Reformatted the `Time` column into 24-hour format (HH:MM).
8. Corrected misspelled entries such as `"Memberr"` to `"Member"`.
9. Replaced missing or undefined customer types (`"-"`) with `"Normal"`.

### üßπ Data Tidiness Issues

To improve structure and clarity:

1. Created a new column `City` with values: `Yangon`, `Naypyitaw`, and `Mandalay`.
2. Dropped old one-hot encoded city columns.
3. Combined the `City` and `Branch` columns into a single column for regional identification.
4. Removed the original `City` and `Branch` columns after merging.
