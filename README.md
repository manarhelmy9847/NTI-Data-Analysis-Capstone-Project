# Capstone Project for the Data Analysis Track at NTI
This repository contains my capstone project for the Data Analysis track at the National Telecommunication Institute (NTI).  The goal of this project is to apply real-world data analysis techniques to explore datasets, uncover meaningful insights, and visualize trends using Python and industry-standard tools.
